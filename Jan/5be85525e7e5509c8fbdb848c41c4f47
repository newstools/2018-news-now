The bail hearing of a 19-year-old Blue Bulls rugby player accused of rape will continue next Monday in the New Brighton Magistrate’s court in Port Elizabeth. During Monday’s bail proceedings, a medical report was submitted as evidence to the court. The Medical report was concluded by health officials at Dora Nginza Hospital and showed that the victim was a virgin before being penetrated and still had bruises on her body later, after the alleged incident. The medical report was read into the record by the Investigating Officer, Micheal Shannigan. The accused, via his legal council Advocate Terry Price, said that the two had consensual sex in his car in December. He also said he would plead not guilty to all the charges against him. The 19-year-old faces two counts of rape and one of robbery, for allegedly stealing the victim’s cellphone. The accused cannot be named until he has pleaded. The former Grey High School pupil has been in custody since his arrest. Algoa FM
