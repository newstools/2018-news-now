Six people were killed and three others injured late last night following a head-on collision on the N12 Highway, roughly 15km outside of Potchefstroom. ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene shortly before midnight, find a bakkie and light motor vehicle in the middle of the road. Both vehicles had sustained a significant amount of damage in the collision. Upon closer inspection, paramedics discovered six patients lying in the light motor vehicle while three were found inside the bakkie. Paramedics assessed the patients in the light motor vehicle and found that two men, a woman and two children, aged between three and four, had all sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Nothing could be done for them and they were later declared dead. A sixth patient from the light motor vehicle, a woman, was found to be in a critical condition. Paramedics treated the woman and provided her with advanced life support interventions. Upon inspection of the bakkie, paramedics found three men inside. Two had sustained moderate injuries while a third had sustained fatal injuries. Nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead. Once paramedics had treated the three patients, the critically injured was airlifted by a private medical helicopter to Lenmed Randfontein for urgent treatment. The two other patients were transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital. The exact details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
