Police spokesperson Thulani Zwane has confirmed that Durban police have arrested a man in connection with the abduction and murder of Siam Lee. Details around the arrest are scant at this stage but sources said the suspect was arrested near Assagai and that a Mercedes Benz Vito – thought to be the same one Lee was said to have been seen leaving in that afternoon – was recovered. An unlicensed 9mm pistol and the suspect’s personal cellphone was also said to have been seized. Lee’s details were apparently found on his cellphone. Sources also said that what they believed could be blood stains were found in the house at which the suspect was arrested. DNA testing was thought to be underway.
